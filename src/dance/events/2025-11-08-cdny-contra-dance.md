A good evening. There were many beginners, but I still attempted an ambitious program and mostly people followed along well. I got some good feedback from Maia (who said I mostly did well but she could give me nitpicks if I wanted them):

* I spent too much time in the workshop covering non-critical stuff that beginners can't internalize--connection, smooth step, etc.
* I left too much room for questions in the workshop, which led to having to cover trivia.
* There are some figures where I could do better prep work to make sure people know the structure before sending them off on it. Example: Promenade—have larks identify the other lark they're going to pass by the left shoulder rather than say, "promenade, passing by the left shoulder"—take a minute first to orient them to which shoulder to pass by. Ditto in A Pirate's Life, rather than the bait and switch of the rory o'more followed by overspinning followed by allemande, introduce the sequence first.
* In a NWT, front-load the most important information. Instead of "Face across, robins chain" say "Robins chain across the set."
