This was a pretty good evening! There were a lot more beginners than I expected (and, seemingly, more than the organizers expected) so I ended up scrapping my program and redoing it. I think it was pretty effective! I mostly carried the beginners along with only a little confusion and still got some interesting dances in. A few notes:

* "Previous partner" is confusing language in First Turn In May for beginners who have no concept of what that means. It might be better to use "corner"? E.g., "On one side of you is your partner, that's the person you asked to dance. On the other side of you is your corner."

Maia had a few notes for me:

* I could have been more of a hardass about chatter. People were very chatty and I didn't really do anything about it.
* For A Thing Of Trust, I could give a style point to the robins when disconnecting from the pousette to raise their arm over the head of the lark they're about to swing.
* You can teach Thing of Trust without naming the pousette, if desired. And in either case, you can prompt it as "two hands with neighbor/partner"

Good Company was excellent as ever and collaboration was fruitful with Helen restraining some of my excesses (wanting to add a seventh dance to the first half and wanting to start the second half with the slipjig, which would have been too much teaching to start with).
