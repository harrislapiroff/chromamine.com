This was a pretty rough night! From the start I was off my game and making awkward comments and missing simple figures from simple dances. My wireless mic was tricky to deal with and I kept popping on the mic. The musicians couldn't hear me well and so weren't doing a lot of noodling. I left the cast off of The Farmer's Joy the first go round! In Impropriety I forgot to mention to people they were switching roles!

Trip to Skye went surprisingly well, though. I was glad I had prepped a careful teach of that. Puck's Deceit went well once or twice through and then quickly fell apart as the short line had to change roles and the roles were pretty different. Switching to an easy Mendocino Redwood after was a good move.

The second half went largely smoothly, though the teaches took a while because I walked them through for every person.
