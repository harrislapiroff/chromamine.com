A decent evening. There were a few beginners who had trouble following along and I felt bad about that, but everyone seemed in good spirits.

I noticed Zero Sum Game is a bit tricky because the circle L all the way in 8 counts is unforgiving. A dancer complained about the music being too fast after that one, but I think it was actually the choreo (or perhaps a combination).

I think Stars of Alberta was too hard for the room – I should file it in the more difficult section of my box. This was the only one where a significant portion of the set fell apart – and Gaye Fifer walked in in the middle! I was so embarrassed. But talking to her about it later she had only compliments for me on the evening and told me she thought I put dancers at ease and that she didn't think "Stars" was a trainwreck because the confused dancers got pulled back in. So _maybe_ I'm being a little extra hard on myself. Maybe.

Alternating Current was a new one for my repertoire and pleasantly it isn't too tricky despite some unusual sequences. I've been on kind of a John Coffman kick lately and he really was the star of this program in particular.

Gaye also told me a nice story about how she met a new dancer this evening who asked her if they had lessons. Gaye said "You're actually a bit late – we had a lesson at 7:30."

The dancer replied, "No, the website says the lesson is at 8:30." And then she pulled up the website on her phone and...

It turned out she thought she was at a Kizomba class! Nevertheless she stayed till the end and asked about how to do more of it, so it seems like, on that metric, it was a successful night.

Oh, also, I did get thirteen dances in, which is fun. I think it's the first time that's happened!
