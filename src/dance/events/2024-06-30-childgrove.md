A really nice evening! There were no beginners to start and only one or two who showed up later so I kept the level fairly high. The crowd was older, but the energy was high, hooting and stomping with the music and rather effusively complimenting me and the band after the dance.

After a few evenings where I got feedback asking me to call longer and walk through more times, Jeff suggested it might be cultural rather than to do with my dance difficulty. I asked the setup organizer and he did indeed tell me that dancers here would be pretty chatty during the walkthrough and were used to two walkthroughs.

Indeed they were pretty chatty so I gave two walkthroughs for most dances. This did mean I ended up more behind than I wanted to be (though this was partially because I forgot the chain in Maliza's and had to walk it through several times), but I made up some time with a couple no-walkthroughs and managed to get in eleven dances running only 10 minutes or so over. (I did ask organizer permission before running over.)

No walkthroughs are apparently quite uncommon here and I got a couple compliments on them, particularly the medley.

Emma had previously suggested a quicker way to get into Soul Reversal's becket indecent waves and I tried it out this evening with success. Simply get folks into improper, tell the larks to alle R half and take L with their partner to make a short wave. However Soul Reversal was the wrong dance for this crowd. It was a little too tight for some of the slower movers and a little too fussy for a crowd not super detail oriented.

Some interesting notes on role terms: This dance is used to ladies/gents calling. To ease them into larks/robins, I gave a little spiel at the beginning. Something like:

> I'm used to calling larks/robins and that's what I'm going to call tonight. I know some of you are used to ladies/gents. If you're a little uncertain about larks/robins, I invite you to think of it as a way to test your contra dance skills with different terms. I'll be gentle. And I suggest you listen to the *syllables* not the words: larks/robins has the same syllables as gents/ladies.

I also noticed a few dancers grumbling a bit to themselves and missing some calls, so I added in some positional cues during the walkthroughs, e.g., "Larks, _you have your left hand free_ to allemande left with each other 1½," which seemed to help. I also noticed myself dropping role terms a few times instead of figure names, which is the opposite of what I usually do – e.g., shortening "larks allemande left" to "allemande left" instead of "larks!" It felt a little like ceding something to lean a little more positional than using role names, but I'm hopeful that what people will remember is, "I went to a larks/robins dance and it wasn't so bad!"
