An OK night. The dancers were fairly inattentive and there were a few beginners, but I managed to get them through the dances I had programmed. It was a short session (2h) but with a couple no walkthroughs and running 10m over (with the permission of organizers) I managed to fit in 9 dances.

I got some particular compliments on the medley! Feeling very pleased that this is a new skill I've developed and been able to flex and deploy on the fly when it's appropriate.

This was my first time calling Charismatic Megafauna and I think it's going to be a good addition to my "glossary plus" category of dances, where it's mostly very easy with one move that's a fun bonus for intermediate dancers – in this case a J-hook promenade.
