I thought this was a really nice dance. I didn't make the program too challenging, but it seemed like folks had a nice time.

- The Digital Divide went fairly well, but people never cottoned on to the alternating parts, so I ended up calling them the whole way through. Possibly this was because I messed up the prompting early in the dance and folks got the messed up version stuck in their heads.
- My Devil's Backbone teach was comparatively weak. Need to come up with a better way to indicate where the single file chase ends. Probably something like, "notice the line you're in nowâ€”at the end of this sequence you will be in the same line, but on the other side."
- I was especially proud of my medleys, which included a number of dances that required quick and precise prompting and even some unusual transitions. (Particularly notably, RBTL required teaching the circulate rapidly and Barack Me -> Wrinkled Ribbon involved doing the transition at the start of B2 by making the promenade into a j-hook promenade.)
- The slipjig contra, Waxmyrtle, went very well!

This was the first time I've ever preplanned a program and stuck to it nearly exactly. (I had initially planned to do a Galaxy Grand Square break for the square but opted for something simpler that wouldn't require as much teaching time.)
