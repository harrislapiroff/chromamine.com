My second time calling the Nantucket dance—and the second Nantucket dance ever. I think I pitched the difficulty a bit too high for the crowd. I thought I could pitch it higher since some folks had experience from last time and we had a few more ringers there this time, but four contras turned out the be a lot and I wished I had fallen back on more party dances.

Beaumont Boom was a particular win, though. A nice mixer that requires no partners and has a fun rhythmic countdown moment. Sam and Erik really played with it too, bringing the music down low when we were getting ready for the boom and then bringing it up loud on "Three, two, one, BOOM!" Definitely going to use that one for future barn dance situations.

I thought Unruly Reunion would be an easier dance because both swings end where they started, but the different ones and twos roles confused a lot of people, unfortunately.

Midwest Folklore appeared to be going better than last time—I *really* taught the circle L 3: "Notice there are four spots in your set. Each person is standing in once. You're going to circle through three of them, count them out as you go." And it looked like people were nailing that. But three couples fully dropped out when they reached the end and I couldn't figure out why! Maybe I didn't explain well enough how to progress back in?
