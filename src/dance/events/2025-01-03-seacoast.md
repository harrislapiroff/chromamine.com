I set out with a goal of calling all dances by non-male choreographers for this evening and succeeded! It did mean I boxed myself in a little bit, not having my usual backups available, so I ended up falling back on a lot of Linda Leslie dances because there were many beginners. Overall the evening went reasonably well though.

It was my first time calling Hume Fogg Reel and I couldn't get the timing on the allemandes to work right. It didn't help that the floor in general didn't have a great sense of timing, but I think I might just not like the mushiness of that particular sequence.
