My third year doing Porchfest contra and it was a really fun event! We had two long lines that stretched the entire block for the dances for everyone and one line of the same size for the experienced dances. I tried to approximately alternate dances for everyone and dances for experienced dancers. I made three kinds of announcements:

- "This is a dance for everyone!"
- "This is a dance for experienced dancers! If you know how to do [X figure] you'll be fine."
- "This dance will have a short walkthrough. Find someone who looks like they know what they're doing and ask them to dance."

Some of the teaches took a little longer than I wanted but I managed to get 9 dances into 2 hours, which is about what I hope for.

- First Turn In May I wanted to experiment with calling role free. I had couples turn to face promenade direction and told them they were "outies" or "innies" depending on whether they were on the inside and outside and that they had to make sure that when it was time to promenade they were on their correct side. This worked!
- I finished with Maid Marian's Fancy, having announced it for experienced dancers. It was a touch too tricky for the crowd, even for experienced dancers. I'd hoped to do one quick walkthrough, but it needed two and I had to run it very short.
- For the circle mixers, instead of one big circle, I asked dancers to make multiple big circles, which worked well.
- Crowd control was tough. It was hard from the stage to distinguish people lining up to dance from people standing around or walking by. Next time it would be nice to have volunteers in the street to help with it.
- It was my first time using Family Contra and it was a nice dance, but it was really crowded and looked a little chaotic and unpleasant, especially for the experienced dancers. Next time I should more frequently have them take hands in long lines so I can see where the lines are and ask them to stretch out. I think in the future I might also prefer the B2: Circle L 1x, zig L, zag R variation over the original B2: DSD around Ns as a couple 1½

I got lots of kudos for managing the chaos, so I think it went well! A couple people came up to ask about BIDA after.
