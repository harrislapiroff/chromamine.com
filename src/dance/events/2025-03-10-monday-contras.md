A really nice evening! I had prepped for an evening without many beginners, but we ended up having a few, so I simplified the first part of my program and was pretty much programming on the fly from there.

A Thing Of Trust was new for me and is a nice simple flowy pousette dance to add to my collection.

I was able to get a swing workshop and an allemande workshop both in and still get a full evening of dances.
