An OK evening. I made a lot of errors early in the evening which I felt bad about but recovered from most of them. Pizza Shop I had mistranscribed and had to bail on, which felt bad.

After the first few dances I got my legs back and mostly called well (though I still had a few minor errors later in the evening). I ran over the first half because I decided to add in an extra dance due to bailing on one, which ultimately cost me a dance in the second half.

I did two quick workshops on the floor â€“ an allemande connection workshop and a swing workshop. I think they both went pretty well, though I could fine tune them. I got one comment that it seemed like I was channeling Lisa Greenleaf.

I got one comment that even though not everything went as planned, I made the dancers feel safe and like I was in control, which, so the commenter said, was even better than everything going perfectly.

Candles in the Dark went well, though I did demo most of the dance (all the half figure eights through the mirror back-to-back). Everyone danced it too.
