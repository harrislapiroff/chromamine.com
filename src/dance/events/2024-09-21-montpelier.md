A really good night! I think I nailed the level of the dance, erring maybe *just* on the difficult side. A lot of dances required two walk throughs, but there were many beginners who skipped the workshop and it seemed like once each dance was underway there were only one or two confused beginner-beginner couples on the floor.

I set a goal for this dance of being able to safely close with a box circulate dance and I nailed it. I was particularly proud of the progression of difficulty over the course of the evening, starting with the easiest dance I know and a circle mixer and gradually working our way up to a figure as challenging as a box circulate. A pretty good range for a single evening!

The hey with hands in Give The Scout A Hand seemed to pose particular confusion for some dancers. This might be a lesson about hey introductions. I deliberately used Autumn Air to introduce a half hey that didn't require anyone to loop over their shoulder on the outside of the set, but later introducing a hey that *did* require that produced confusion.

Catch A Falling Star worked well after two walkthroughs, but I did notice, even though I emphasized that the robins should slide nose-to-nose past each other, a lot of dancers insisted on doing an allemande left half and then switching hands to star right. Might need to emphasize, "_Drop hands_ and slide nose-to-nose past each other." Or maybe the dance can have a variation!

I got lots of nice feedback in my notebook:

- "The way you keep your voice calm and upbeat makes it easier to follow and learn the moves! Thanks!!!"
- "Nice upbeat tone. Very positive. People are having a good time."
- "Thought the walkthrough was one of the BEST I've ever seen. Minimum of confused new folks. Also super appreciate increasing difficulty over the course of the night. Come back! :)"
