I led a 50 minute festival workshop with a combination of English and Contra dances that shared figures. It seemed like there was a decent mix of dancers' whose primary form was each. The walkthrough for Mad Robin got a little dicey (the initial sequence was tricky and I accidentally said "You're now progressed with the ones above" which caused a lot of confusion). I ran Mad Robin extra long because the line was long and I wanted as many people as possible to get a chance to be ones, but it meant I had less time for the other dances.

The other teaches went pretty smoothly. I was particularly proud at the end when I was running out of time, I managed to teach Labor Of Love (including contra corners) very rapidly and end within seconds of my alloted time slot.

I got lots of compliments after including someone who told me they had never understood corners in English before, but the way I explained it made sense for the first time to them. I don't think I did anything especially unusual—I told them to take hands four, then face their neighbor across. "There's someone in your set diagonally across from you. If they're on your right diagonal, you're both first corners. If they're on your left diagonal, you're both second corners."

In retrospect, I do also note that in Trip To Tunbridge and Labor of Love, serendipitously, the active couple has two corners each on the right and left diagonal respectively, which may have provided some additional reinforcement of the concept and a common thread to tie them together—one which I had not planned for at all!
