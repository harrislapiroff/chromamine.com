This was a *wonderful* evening. Julie, Milo, and Max were great on music and the dancers were on it. I feel a little guilty that part of what made it so good was that there were no beginners, so I was able to step up the level of the dances. Even still I think my teaches and calling were exceptionally *on* this night. Some notes:

- It was great to start high energy with a no walkthrough.
- I made a comment during "Autumn Air" – "This part flows if you let it and let go of your expectations" which I think was helpful for getting dancers to flow smoothly through the serpentine sequence.
- Having failed at "Mouse In The Car" last time I tried it, I was happy to succeed this time.
- I pushed the level of my medley calling up another notch. The second dance, Folklife Frolic, started with a right hand star → right allemande → long waves circulate. I knew in advance this might fall apart so I prepped the dancers saying, "Notice which direction you're progressing. If you get lost, keep progressing that way." It did indeed fall apart the first time through. I said, "We're gonna try it again!" and kept going, but flubbed the prompting myself the second time. I said, "Let's try that one more time!" and the third time it worked perfectly. I thought it was a satisfying moment, and I hope that dancers did too. I was thinking about Brooke's advice that when you let dancers pull a dance together without stopping it, you subtly teach them that mistakes are OK. Even the third dance in the medley "Train Delay" added a bit of a trick with the star → shadow box-the-gnat, but dancers caught on quickly.
- During "My Right Hand Man" I said, "we're going to do a ricochet hey" which was a mistake, because I saw dancers go to ricochet on the first pass and I had to pause to clean up ande explain. Next time I'll just prompt "Hey for four" and then say "larks when you meet the second time, ricochet."
- I got thirteen dances in without running them particularly short just because teaches were so efficient!
