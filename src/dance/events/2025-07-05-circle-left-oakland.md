A pretty good evening. I pitched the level a bit too high and for hubris didn't bring it down. Everything worked and nothing fell apart, but some beginners struggled a bit.

I've concluded that I've now swung too far in the direction of being verbose when teaching. Adding in the style points and history notes has become a bit too much and I should swing back a bit in the other direction.

In particular I stumbled a bit over the teach of the hey in Rockin Robin. It's kind of a tricky hey to teach and I also flubbed a bit (taught it as a half hey when it should have been a full hey).

The medley went well and people seemed proud of themselves for achieving it.

Overall a good, but not perfect, evening.
