A good dance! A small, cute community with a short dance (2h). There were a lot of beginners, but I thought my program pulled them along quite well. Both comments in my comment book were some variation of: "I was worried when you started with a becket dance, but it turned out fine!" I don't think these are necessarily particularly actionable. It's possible I should think through how to get folks into becket for the first dance without teaching improper formation.

Because I couldn't do any no-walkthroughs and the number of beginners dictated two walkthroughs for most of the dances (only one for the second half dances) I only got through 8 dances – ending just a couple minutes over – but it felt like a pretty satisfying evening.
