The first part of a double dance.

It was my first time calling a challenging dance! I was a little concerned I had aimed too high with my program but the dancers kept up very well. I didn't have to simplify much, I ended up dropping a couple slots and simplifying the second half, but mostly for time. In addition to needing more time for walkthroughs, there was also a Balkan dance lesson during the break which made it a little longer than usual.

At the last second I got nervous about calling a box circulate in the middle dance in the medley, so I did a bit where I walked through the first half of Folklife Frolic with the dancers and then said, "Okay, but that's not what we're doing right now, I just wanted to see you do it. Go back to your original places, we're doing a no walkthrough." Which got a good laugh. Dancers reported to me afterward that the surprise of the walkthrough coming back midway through was fun. Of course this is a gag that stops working once you get a reputation for doing it ðŸ˜…

Caller Help Line was a debut and it seemed to work pretty well. I got some feedback on it:

- Someone really liked the fact that the progression happened on the rory o'more slide since usually that's a figure you do back and forth and don't end up going anywhere.
- Someone wasn't sure why I made such a big deal about it being new and weird. (I think this is a good thing! It's a weird dance from a caller perspective but possibly not weird on the floor!)
- The extended circulate worked, but people were inclined to cut diagonal straight for their endpoint instead of looping around.
- The extended circulate felt more like a chase than a circulate.
- The extended circulate allowed for some fun flourishes including twirling a neighbor into place or doing an eye contact chase.

I also got some feedback on "Are You 'Most Done?" notably:

- One dancer felt that in general the dance didn't flow very well, but the right diagonal hey was very cool.
- The larks alle R into a partner swing was awkward since larks need their right hand free to wrap around their partner's back for the swing position. (I suspect this didn't affect dancers who twirl out of their allemandes, which may be why I've never noticed it.)
