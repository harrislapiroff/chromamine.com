Lots of beginners. An OK evening. A few notes on dances:

* First Turn In May, timing of the allemandes is really tricky. Gotta get better at committing to a specific timing. Maia suggested replacing it with: Alle L 1x (8), Alle R 1x (8), pass by R and swing (16).
* Festival Waves is a bit trickier than I realized for beginners to end up on the correct side. Might be important to tell the larks to walk to their neighbor, but tell the robins to stay where they are.
