A fun evening! I threw in a few easier ones that were nevertheless new to me (_Mayflies_, _Petronella Jig_) and they seemed to go over well. The second half I called almost like a challenging contra – I was feeling a little indulgent because it was my birthday dance. A few dancers clearly fatigued of the difficulty of the first two (Chris's Poetic Orangutan, interestingly, hasn't proved to be too tricky either of the times I've called it) but a bunch were clearly having a great time. One dancer shouted out, "_WE DID IT_," when we finished _Soul Reversal_.

One teaching note on _Petronella Jig_ is to figure out a way to be clearer about how to end up in the diamond. It took dancers a moment to figure it out during the walkthrough. Some combination of:

* Facing the same neighbors
* Stay close
* Turn the courtesy turn 45° extra
* To put the robins back to back with another robin in the center of the set
* Forming a diamond with those same neighbors

Etc.
