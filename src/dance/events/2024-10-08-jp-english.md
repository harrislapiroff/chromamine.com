(I don't actually remember where we placed the break. It may have been before "Minnows.")

A successful first foray into English Dance leading. It was nice to split the evening with Sam and get to observe some of the ways ECD differs from calling contras.

There were a few moments where I could have been more decisive about how I wanted a figure to be dances. In Bluebonnets in particular, a dancer asked me if dancers were in a diamond after the balance back and right and I gave a wishy washy answer where I should have said yes.

Sam also noted that I wasn't sufficiently careful in teaching the crucial figure in Trip to Tunbridge, teaching that the last actives pass by right happens very quickly and you should sweep out into the lines facing out.

Other things went very well!
