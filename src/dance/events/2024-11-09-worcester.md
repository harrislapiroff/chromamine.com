A great evening overall! I bombed Kimmeswick Express (it was too complex for the crowd and I messed up the timing) but the rest went great. I wasn't thrilled about calling gendered terms, but it was satisfying running my workshop in a way that assigned people roles regardless of gender as a way of establishing that anyone can dance any role right off the bat.

I received lots of compliments on the evening, including this excellent testimonial in my book:

> I have been contra dancing for seven years, but I learned things from Harris that I never learned before. Your beginner lesson was the best I have ever been a part of.
>
> Harris is an exceptional caller! We all had a great time.

I gave a large number of floor demos, which is becoming something of a signature move of mine. I demoed doing the swing with proper connection and the A part of Chris's Poetic Orangutan.

I got lots of compliments on the medley including one dancer who told me "What this dance needs is a caller who trusts the dancers and when you called the medley it showed your skill, but it also put the trust in the dancers—and it worked!"

I think I'd like to keep doing more floor demos of technique as something that sets me apart from other callers and raises the skill floor of the dance.
