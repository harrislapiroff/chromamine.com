My write up as I sent it to my mentor:

> * I made a number of small technical errors, largely things I know what I did wrong and hot to fix. Notably, though, I tried to do Michedonia early in the evening, taught it incorrectly (with a ptr two-hand-turn both times) and didn't want to figure out how to fix it in the moment, so I scrapped it for the Minor Spaniard and brought it back later when I had worked out my error.
> * Of about 16 dancers, two were complete beginners and another two seemed fairly new (or were perpetual beginners), so I adjusted my teaching to be more thorough, which took a bit more time. I had to rearrange my program substantially, moving most of my easier dances to the top of the program.
> * I struggled a bit with how much to teach to the beginners and risk over-teaching. One moment I was proud of striking this balance: I saw one of the newbies struggling to cast off in the correct direction. Wanting to demo the cast, but also give something to the experienced dancers, I came down to the floor and demoed the cast while reminding everyone that it is an opportunity to have a moment of connection with you partner before you turn away.
> * I was going to follow up Jack's Maggot with some trickier dances, but some of the beginners never got the hey-for-three, so I adjusted my program to keep the remaining first half dances pretty simple (breaking your "up-to-one-3/4-per-half" suggestion in the process).
> * In the second half we had eight experienced dancers, which was perfect for two of the dances I had planned, your Chocolate Equation and Trip To Tunbridge done with a Scottish-style progression as you taught me. The teaches for both were pretty long. I walked the significant sections (the hey -> falling star for Chocolate Equation and the corner turns -> progression for Trip to Tunbridge) for all four couples.
> * People seemed to enjoy the challenge of Chocolate Equation, though the falling star progression got pretty messy. I think I could clean up my teach there.
> * One dancer told me they appreciated that I didn't stop the dance when the progression was breaking down but allowed the dancers to recover, which they did.
> * I heard some murmurings of appreciation from experienced dancers for doing Trip To Tunbridge in a way they hadn't done before.
> * I mentioned mid-evening that it was my first time leading a full evening of ECD and an organizers came up to me after to say that she would have no idea, so I think I did reasonably well and they'll have me back!
