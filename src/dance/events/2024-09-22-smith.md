Lots of beginners came to this first-of-the-semester college dance! I might have pitched the difficulty a touch too high, but it seemed like overall folks had a good time and none of the sets fell apart.

Star Trek Phraser worked well, though timing was challenging. Dancers kept finishing their left hand star late and then trying to wait until A2 to start the oval left. (On the other hand, this was a good sign that they were listening to the phrases in the music!)

Autumn Air was simply too challenging of a dance for this particular crowd. The circle to chain transition was too tricky.

The Farmer's Joy worked quite well and I was glad to get experience teaching and calling it so I can have it in my ECD repertoire as an easy dance. It's a clever dance for beginners because the most confusing moment—"ones cross up between the twos"—is made easier by the fact that their destination is home. Though the dance is written proper, the bulk of the action is between corners, so I taught it as improper and referred to first corners as "robins" and second corners as "larks" which worked well.
