A bit of a small dance because it was during a snowstorm. No new dancers, only a couple beginners. I had prepared for a beginner heavy dance and had to up the program.

I wanted to do Beneficial Tradition in the second half, but there were too few dancers. Wish I had done it in the first half instead.

I tried to do Mouse in the Car which failed and I switched to Kimmswick Express instead. At the end there were only eight dancers so they asked to try the square again. It didn't work, so I did Read Between the Lines nwt instead.

A decent evening, considering the turnout.
