I've made notes about rolling starts and no walkthroughs to the best of my recollections, but I may have mixed up some of them.

Went well! Made some changes from [last year](https://chromamine.com/2023/05/calling-dances-at-porchfest/):

- I kept control of dance duration
- I added in two circle mixers "for everyone"
- I was more clear and deliberate about which dances beginners could jump into saying one of the following:
  - "This next dance is a circle mixer for anyone to join"
  - "This next dance will have a short walkthrough. If you'd like to join, find an experienced dancer to pull you through it."
  - "This next dance is for experienced dancers. If you know how to do a hey, you'll be fine."

Overall it was a little less chaotic than last time. I'm not sure if this was because the most chaotic crowds were stolen away by the [Guster show](https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/05/12/guster-plays-to-a-packed-crowd-at-somerville-porchfest/) or because I was clearer about which dances beginners should join in on (and specifically set out some dances for beginners).

Also less hot than last time which was good.

I got through 7 dances in 1.5 hours, which was roughly what I was aiming for. Kingfisher also started with a quick warm up tune and concluded with a waltz.

The line was huge – it stretched half the block, even for the dances I called for experienced dancers. I was tempted to split into two lines, but for some reason the street had been incompletely closed and cars kept coming through.

At the end, a *bunch* of new couples in a row joined for Train Delay. I think they hadn't heard my "This dance is for experienced dancers" announcement, or chose to ignore it. When I saw this I think I said something like, "This dance is for experienced dancers and has some figures we haven't done yet. If you're new, well... you'll probably have fun, but you might struggle a bit first." I saw some give each other looks, but no one left the line. They *really* didn't get the walkthrough, but I didn't slow down for them because I wanted Kingfisher to be able to play and we were running short on time. (And I could hear them starting a rolling start in the background.) And it all worked out! I actually think the fact that Train Delay has a shadow interaction helped the newcomers because they had another familiar face to look for for part of the dance and it got them more interaction time with experienced dancers. After about four times through they were fully integrated and the dance was running smoothly.
