A good evening! I had some clumsy teaching moments and made some errors (dropping figures and then noticing, not getting people into the correct places for the dolphin hey, etc.).

Dandelion In The Green was a surprise challenge since I've led it successfully before, but this time around I made multiple errors. The primary error was during the sequence where neighbors turn by L to have the ones face in I told one side to turn 1 1/2—there isn't really time for that. Should have been 1/2. I didn't have the distance noted on my card, just "until the ones face in"—have updated it now. This cascaded to us getting the timing wrong because the hand turns were taking too long and I had to stop the dance and walk it through more carefully with noodling. We eventually got it to work but dancers had to rush through the hand turns and I didn't understand my error until after the dance.

The other teaches all went well with only minor errors in teaching or prompting that were quickly corrected.

I was especially pleased with how well Hazelfern Place went—this was the one that I expected to be the most challenging, but the teach went more smoothly than many of the others! Possibly because I prepped it the most since I was so nervous about it.

Pluck Me A Fig was also new for me and went quite well.

Trip To Provence I neglected to give guidance on who should go under in the box the gnat. I intended to first suggest the dancer on the left file start the half figure eight and then say the same dancer should go under. I did the first half, but not the second. There was no confusion, thankfully, but I would have preferred to offer people a default to follow.

In Minnows I gave a style point about doing an eye-contact half figure eight, as advised in Melissa's notes, but I think this crowd wasn't quite adept enough for that particular note and I should probably have left it out. (I noticed some minor collisions.)

I was going to close with Monterey Ploughman, but I was short on time and figured the teach would take too long and possibly even run over since it was new to me and I could flub it, so I switched to Faithless Nancy Dawson, which was the right call.
