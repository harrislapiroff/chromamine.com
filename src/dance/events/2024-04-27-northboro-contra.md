A bit of an odd gig. The first ladies/gents dance I've called in many many years and it was a bit uncomfortable for me and a bit of a challenge as well! I kept things easy for the dancers who were a mixed crowd and on the older side and also for my own adapting to the terminology. One dancer who I see regularly at Monday Concord came up to me after to thank me for my calling and appreciate how good I always am with beginners. "So clear!" That was a nice moment.
