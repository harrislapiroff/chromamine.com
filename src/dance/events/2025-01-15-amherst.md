A really nice evening! Had a surprising number of beginners (a crew of Smithies) arrive at the start and had to scrap my more challenging program for something a little easier. Was still able to get a medley and an English dance into the second half.

Emma had a few useful bits of feedback on my beginner workshop:

- It might be nice to have people try the swing with multiple people somehow.
- Swing position involved not just being side by side but angling torso towards each other. It's possible I could say something once they're in the side by side position about angling their torso without moving their feet.
- She wasn't persuaded by the use of the word "tension."

She also noted that she did think people's allemandes were better after the mini workshop!
