A nice evening. Played with an old-time band that just wanted to play one tune per dance and not think about it too much, which was actually pretty relaxing. I picked out mostly dances I thought would work with old-time and I think a good evening was had by all. There were ~36 dancers, which is pretty well-attended for Berkeley Contra â€“ a sweet small dance.
