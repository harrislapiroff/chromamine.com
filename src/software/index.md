title: "Harris Lapiroff: Software Engineer, Designer, Manager"
---

I'm a **software engineer**, **designer**, and **manager** specializing in data visualizations, data processing, and the web. By day I am the [Engineering Manager (Web)][] at [Freedom of the Press Foundation][] where I oversee a small team of developers maintaining a set of web-based projects at the intersection of digital security, privacy, and press freedom. Among these is the [U.S. Press Freedom Tracker](https://pressfreedomtracker.us/), a comprehensive database of press freedom violations in the United States.

I occasionally take side jobs. I'm picky about what work I take on. The following qualities make for a good fit for me:

* It involves **data cleaning**, **visualization**, or **analysis**. (You wouldn't think data cleaning would be the most appealing thing in the world, but I find work like this to be satisfying.)
* It is a **one-off project** rather than one I am committing to maintaining long-term. I will code and document in such a way that another engineer can pick it up with minimal trouble.
* It is something that **contributes to the public good in a high-impact way**.
* It has a **minimum budget of $1,000**. More, if it is any amount of complex.

if you think you have a job that fits some or all of those criteria, please get in touch: [software@chromamine.com][].
