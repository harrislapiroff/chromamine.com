My primary home on the internet is this website â€“ but there's a number of other services you can find me on or reach me privately through.

:::note
This page also serves as reasonably strong verification that any account linked here is actually mine and under my control[^1].

If someone claiming to be me contacts you from a different platform or account, feel free to contact me through one of the means below to verify. I'm never offended by good security.
