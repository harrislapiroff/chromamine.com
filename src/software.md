title: "Harris Lapiroff: Software Engineer, Designer, Manager"
---

I'm a **software engineer**, **designer**, and **manager** specializing in data visualizations, data processing, and the web.

By day I am the [Engineering Manager][] at [Freedom of the Press Foundation][] for the web and Dangerzone teams. I oversee two small teams of developers maintaining a set of projects at the intersection of digital security, privacy, and press freedom. Among these are the [U.S. Press Freedom Tracker](https://pressfreedomtracker.us/), a comprehensive database of press freedom violations in the United States, and [Dangerzone](https://dangerzone.rocks/), a tool for converting potentially unsafe documents to safe PDFs.

I occasionally take side jobs, but because I have a full-time job, friends, partners, hobbies, and generally limited free time, I tend to be picky about the work I take on. The following qualities make a job a good fit for me:

* It involves **data cleaning**, **visualization**, or **analysis**. (You wouldn't think busy work like data cleaning would make the cut, but I find it to be satisfying.)
* It is a **one-off project** without the expectation of long-term maintenance from me. I will happily provide thorough documentation for others to maintain it.
* It is something that **contributes to the public good in a high-impact way**.
* It has a **minimum budget of $1,000**. If it is any amount of complex the budget is larger than that.

If you think you have a job that fits some or all of those criteria, please get in touch: [software@chromamine.com][].
