In 2019 I decided to get back into [contra dance][] calling after a multi-year stretch of doing very little of it. I called one dance in December, one dance in January of 2020, and then the pandemic hit. Oops.

But when my local dances started back up in 2022 I got into it again and called five dances that year:

* [BIDA][] in Cambridge MA once[^1],
* [Monday Contras][] in Concord MA three times. This was particularly generous because my first evening with them was error-ridden, but I was grateful for the opportunity to redeem myself a month later.
* [Common Floor Contra][] in Topsham ME once.

In 2023 I called thirteen, almost fourteen, dances:

* [Monday Contras][] (5 evenings, two of which were half evenings, split between me and an up-and-coming caller)
* [BIDA][] (1 evening)
* [Common Floor Contra][], now in Portland ME (1 evening)
* [Brooklyn Contra][] in Brooklyn NY (1 evening)
* [Downtown Amherst Contradance][] in Amherst MA (1 evening)
* [Contra MontrÃ©al][] in MontrÃ©al QC (1 evening)
* Smith College Contra Dance in Northampton MA (1 afternoon)
* [BFMS Wednesday][] (1 evening)
* [Porchfest][] on [Jeff Kaufman][]'s porch in Somerville MA (1 afternoon)
* I had to cancel one gig because I had covid ðŸ˜•

Here are the different dance choreographies I called in 2023, their choreographers, and how many times I called them. You can see which ones I return to again and again. Most at the top of the list are from Maia McCormick's "[My Go-To Dances](https://contra.maiamccormick.com/blog/2022/10/16/go-to-dances.html)" which was instrumental in helping me build my collection up when I started calling again.

Though I had a bit of experience calling from my college days and a while after, when I resumed, it mostly manifested as baseline comfort with the technical skills of calling â€“ using the right words, listening for the phrases in music, and being on time. In the past couple years I've developed a much stronger sense of how to program the arc of an evening, how to communicate with a band, and how to watch and respond to a hall.

One of the great pleasures of calling these past couple years has been the chance to provide some mentorship and opportunity to newer callers, even in my own still-learning state. I had the chance to share the stage with two up-and-coming callers over the past year and have since watched them rocket off onto their own successful calling careers.[^3]

I've spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of a caller I am. Some callers have a lot of on stage charisma â€“ they're Performers with a capital P. I'm not sure that's ever going to be me; I try to evoke a friendly and encouraging charm, but I don't think I have the natural performance instinct. I'm sure I'll gain some of that over time, but I've tried to lean into what I see as my strengths: going deep on efficiency, clarity, and attentiveness to the room.

I've also concluded that I really like doing this. I think I've gotten pretty good at it and I'm determined to get better.[^4]

***

I have some calling goals for the future:

* Go on a tour with a band. I love the idea of building rapport, debriefing each dance, and testing out refinements daily. I have a Midwest tour scheduled this summer with [Kingfisher][], but I'm still looking to do even more of this! (If you're a band interested in bringing a caller on tour with you, [let me know][contact] ðŸ˜‡!)
* Get booked to call a challenging/advanced dance.
* Get booked to call a weekend and eventually a full week camp.

If you want to see me call somewhere, check out my [contra dance page][harriscontra] for my schedule.

::: note
In the process of putting together this list I noticed four evenings over the past two years that I had neglected to note in my records, so it's very possible I missed others that I *still didn't* catch! (If you're an organizer and you know you booked me, but don't see it on this list, let me know!) Getting more consistent about how I record my evenings is a 2024 goal.
:::

[^1]: I'm on the BIDA board and specifically I am the caller booker, so I try not to book myself too frequently, as a conflict of interest issue. Also, as a practical matter, it's useful to keep myself in reserve for last minute cancellations or hard-to-book dates.
[^2]: Dean Snipes and Linda Leslie wrote almost the same dance independently, so I try to credit both when I mention it.
[^3]: I'd be remiss not to mention the mentorship I've *received* as well, in particular from [Don Veino][] who gave me crucial feedback in my early evenings of calling Monday Contras, [Sue Rosen][] who has organized a number of up-and-coming caller chats, and [Maia McCormick][] who has consistently been there for assistance with program ideas, debriefing dances, or kicking around calling ideas generally.
[^4]: I had a moment of doubt about including this line here. In between when I started drafting it and finished publishing it, I called a slot at the BIDA 15th Anniversary caller extravaganza and I flubbed it. I don't feel like a particularly good caller this week. But, errors happen. I'm better than my worst nights and I'm getting better still.
