Here’s a small purchase that’s been bringing me some satisfaction lately:

I find it really annoying when an appliance comes with a long cord and no way to store it. Especially if it’s an appliance I find myself moving frequently (like my kitchen mixer) or even if it’s one where I only move it occasionally but it’s really awkward when I do (like a window AC unit).

I found these stick on cable organizers that solve this problem for me! [These](https://a.co/d/4PTlOvj) are the particular ones I purchased but I’m sure there’s lots of similar options on and off of Amazon.
