Why do I want to have a blog?

1. **I used to write.** I was pretty good at it, I think. I'm pretty rusty now. I've spent the past decade focusing on other things, which I did on purpose, but I always told myself I could get back to writing someday if I wanted to. I think I'd like that now.
2. **I want to document the things I know and things I learn.** I want to have a place to point to when someone asks me a question like "[What kind of CO₂ monitor do you use and do you like it?][co2]" or "Why do you think contra dances should include mixers?". I want this to share with others, but I also want it for Future Harris to refer back to. My brain is leaky. Hopefully my blog is not.
3. **I love a technical playground.** Professional work can be a limiting, especially as I find myself doing more management as my career matures. I've been a web developer and designer most of my life and I enjoy it. I like to have a place to experiment with technologies, design ideas, etc., unconstrained by professional concerns.
4. **I can own my content.** I'll post throwaway thoughts and day-to-day tidbits on social media, but, especially with the things I spend more effort on, I want to be able to preserve them in their best format and to not depend on third-parties for how easy they are to find or read. I want to know that – if I so choose – I can keep them online myself for 20 years or more. I'll likely follow a [POSSE][] approach here[^1].

So I've created this new blog. I've had blogs in the past, starting way back in my high school days. I've maintained them with greater and lesser success at times and I make no promises about how well I'll do with this one. We'll see how it goes.

I've gone back through my social media presences and old blogs and moved over some of the old content that seems particularly worth preserving. I'll do more of this over time. My archive will grow in both directions.

## Design

I spent a fair bit of time playing with different designs that I wasn't satisfied with. I'm still not really satisfied, but I've chosen a direction I mostly like. I aimed for a balance of retro and contemporary. I wanted something that felt minimal at a glance but left room for some more elaborate flourishes and most importantly something unapologetically nerdy.
