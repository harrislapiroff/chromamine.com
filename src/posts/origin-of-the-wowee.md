For years now, one of my pet favorites in contra dancing has been the "wowee," a figure that involves rolling away with your neighbor across the set and immediately releasing the connection to catch your partner for a swing. It's got good energy, flow, and when you successfully catch your partner on time coming out of the rollaway, it feels *great*. A couple of my favorite dances with the figure are Tavi Merrill's "[Soul Reversal][]" and Chris Page's "[Roll Twelve][]."

When I first danced a dance with the figure, someone told me the term and figure were both borrowed from Modern Western Square Dancing. This is also the story I find when I search "wowee contra dance" on the internet. But MWSD dancers I came across said, "Nope, that's not a figure." (Being as MWSD figures and calling standards are more [codified][] than contra, I trusted them to know.) At some point someone else told me it was a Maine-ism coined by a particular Maine caller, but I was fairly sure that wasn't true either.

At a January Monday Contras dance, I called a dance with a wowee in it and someone there told me the figure came from Larry Jennings. A few quick internet searches later and I was able to seemingly confirm this with a PDF of Jennings's book *Give and Take*, which includes a number of dances containing the figure and a note about the name (Jennings uses "W" for _women_, which was the common role term at the time, though most dances I call use _robin_ now.):

> WOWEE by Larry Jennings  
> Becket formation (ccw prog): S  
> 
> 1\. Bal in cir (of four); W roll R to swap with N & take sw pos 2. Sw pt 3. Cir L 4. Cir R 5. 1/2 W ch 6. Long lines: fwd & bk 7. 1/2 W ch & note cpl on L diag 8. 1/2 prom & loop to face noted cpl  
> Ph 8: The noted couple are your next neighbors, but the promenade is initiated by the current men passing by left shoulders.
> 
> _The entry into the swing of ph 2 was suggested (independently, so far as I know) by Merilee Karr and Gene Hubert. I like to give it a snappy interpretation and call it "wowee" when so danced._

I didn't actually procure a hard copy of the book to confirm (yet) just a rogue PDF floating around the internet, but I'm now confident enough that this is the origin of the phrase and now *I've* documented it on the internet to correct the record.

Also, ack! Chris Page's "Roll Twelve" even notes that it's based on a dance, "[Roll Eleven]," by Sue Rosen and Larry Jennings! I should have followed that thread sooner.
