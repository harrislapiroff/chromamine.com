I've just wrapped up the last dance of my year of calling. I've collected an assortment of reflections and notes. Some things that happened this year:

* I had the opportunity to [go on tour with a band](/2024/07/summer-tour-with-kingfisher-reflections/), Kingfisher, across the midwest and experience a contra dance community and culture that was somewhat different from the east coast.
* I called my first challenging dance/double dance at [Brooklyn Contra](https://www.brooklyncontra.org/).
* I took Will Mentor's "Square Dance Callers Course" at CDSS American Week at Pinewoods and learned to call traditional squares.
* I took Brooke Friendly's "English Dance Leaders Course" at CDSS Harmony of Song and Dance Week at Pinewoods and have co-led a couple English Country Dance evenings since.

I also continued to develop my skills and try to hone my particular calling style. [Last year I wrote](/2024/02/contra-calling-2022-2023/):

> I've spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of a caller I am. Some callers have a lot of on stage charisma – they're Performers with a capital P. I'm not sure that's ever going to be me; I try to evoke a friendly and encouraging charm, but I don't think I have the natural performance instinct. I'm sure I'll gain some of that over time, but I've tried to lean into what I see as my strengths: going deep on efficiency, clarity, and attentiveness to the room.

This is still true – to an extent. I still see my quieter stage presence as something that I have to compensate for with other skills. I still have an abiding interest in efficiency, clarity, and attentiveness. But as [Ruthie](https://ruthiebyers.com) pointed out when I was working through thoughts about what kind of caller I am, those are the baseline interests almost all callers must share. The skills I have that I find myself most interested in honing are creating a warm, welcoming, safe environment to learn. I *love* the task of encountering a dance full of beginners or a mixed-level evening and working out the puzzle of carrying them along, increasing their skill as we go, while keeping things light, fun, and stress-free. I think I'm reasonably good at it and I find myself invested in getting even better.

Some skills I've been working on this year:

**Managing beginner crowds:** I called the [Nantucket dance](/2024/05/calling-the-first-dance-in-a-community/) twice, a dance of nearly all beginners, and, while I don't think I did a perfect job either time, I used both events as opportunities to build repertoire appropriate for absolute beginners and practice thinking through how to get them from zero to a contra dance. I also called Porchfest for the second year running and the first Smith College Contra Dane of the semester (also for the second year running), both events with unusually high proportions of beginners.

**Honing my beginner workshop:** I've gotten lots of feedback on my beginner workshop and I've been sharpening it as much as I can. I'd like to write a longer blog post on this at some point, because the beginner workshop is a *very* interesting problem for me. I can't simply *add* things to the workshop. My workshop already often runs up against my time limits. I end up devising (or often stealing from other callers – I won't pretend I came up with these myself) ways to teach multiple things at the same time. Some examples:

* When teaching the initial circle left/circle right, I now count to 8 or hum a tune to prime beginners to expect figures to match the phrase – without explicitly teaching anything about music or timing.
* When practicing allemandes I have them go 1½ with each partner, progressing around a circle, as in a circle mixer. This serves the triple role of practicing allemandes, experiencing progression, and mixing up so they're not with the same partner all workshop.

**English Country Dances and Square Dances:** I've added both English Country Dance and Square Dance to my calling repertoire. I've mixed both into contra evenings (as well as barn dances) to give my programs more texture and variety and have more tools to handle a variety of type of crowds – but I've also branched out into calling evenings of ECD, splitting a couple evenings in the Boston area with Sam Weiler (and booking some full evenings on my own for next year)!

**Teaching from the floor:** I used to despise floor demos. *I can walk most things through more quickly from the stage,* I used to think. I'm over that. It's not true *and* I've learned another reason to love floor demos – they give me an opportunity to teach technique. I think a lot about the problem of elevating the skill of a contra community and this is one attempt to tackle that. I now often mix a brief workshop on how to give good connection in a swing or an allemande into my evening programs. Contra dancers are notoriously impatient with walkthroughs (especially on the east coast) so I'm anticipating for the moment when I lean too far into this and get the feedback that I'm being too teacher-y and they just want to dance, but so far I've gotten largely compliments on this approach.

**Making a goal for my evenings:** One thing Brooke Friendly taught me about programming evenings (for ECD, but I think this also carries over to contra) was to choose a goal for an evening to form the core that you build your program around. I don't always do this, but it's been helpful, both for staring at a blank program and starting somewhere and for finding ways to push myself. Some example goals I've had:

* "I'm going to do a no walkthrough surprise medley in the second half and everyone will get it,"
* "Dancers will have a lot of same-role interaction this evening, but not so much that they notice anything unusual,"
* "Every dance this evening will teach quickly and smoothly," (sure, this should be a goal for every evening, but when I *explicitly* set it out as my core goal, it changes how I program)

I still only leave about 50% of the evenings I call thinking to myself, _Wow, I did a great job!_ It's hard to say to what extent that reflects skills still to develop, to what extent it's a result of my standards increasing as my skills increase, and to what extent it's just an insecurity that I'll forever half to live with.
