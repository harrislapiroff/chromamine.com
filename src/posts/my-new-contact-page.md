Recently, as some of my friends are leaving or thinking about leaving Facebook, I've had more of them share forms to collect contact information from friends they might otherwise lose touch with. I think this is a great idea – to make our connections robust against the whims of social media platforms – and to that end I will happily fill out as many contact forms as my friends want to send me.

I also don't want anyone to lose touch with me because they decide not to send out such a form or I fail to see one that they do. So, let me say:

This website is my permanent home base on the internet – I've owned this domain name, `chromamine.com`, for [over 20 years](https://lookup.icann.org/whois/en?q=chromamine.com) and I plan to continue for as long as owning a domain name is relevant. You can always find me here.

I'm a person who is not especially cautious with sharing my contact information (many people are, with good reason, but I am not) so I've also created a new contact page that's as thorough as I could make it. It includes ways to message me privately as well as every public social media account I'm active on.
