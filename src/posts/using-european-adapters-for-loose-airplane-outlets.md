One minor travel annoyance I've regularly encountered is that airplane outlets don't hold U.S.-style power plugs ([types A/B][]) snugly. My devices come unplugged frequently during a flight, especially frustrating when it's fussy to navigate that awkward under seat space.

While taking a couple trips to Europe this past year, I discovered that airplane outlets are international and specifically that [type E/F][] plugs (used in a number of European countries and beyond) fit more snugly and hold for the entire flight.

Especially since I'm almost always charging USB-powered devices and many newer international adapters include USB ports, I don't even have to use an *additional* adapter, just a *different* one.

I now pack an international adapter whenever I fly, even if I'm just traveling domestically.
