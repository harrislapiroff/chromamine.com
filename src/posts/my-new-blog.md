Why do I want to have a blog?

1. **I used to write.** I was reasonably good at it, I think. I'm pretty rusty now. I've spent the past decade focusing on other things, which I did purposefully, but I always told myself I could get back to writing someday if I wanted to.
2. **I want to document the things I know and things I learn.** I want to have a place to point to when someone asks me a question like "[What kind of CO₂ monitor do you use and do you like it?][co2]" or "[Why do you think contra dances should include mixers?][mixers]". I want this to share with others, but I also want it for Future Harris to refer back to. My brain is leaky. Hopefully my blog is not.
3. **I love a technical playground.** Professional work can be a limiting, especially as I find myself doing more management and less code over time. I've been a web developer and designer most of my life and I enjoy it. On top of writing, it's nice to have a place to experiment with different technologies, design ideas, etc., unconstrained by professional concerns.
4. **I can own my content.** I'll post throwaway thoughts and day-to-day tidbits on social media, but, especially with the things I spend more effort on, I want to preserve them in their best format and not depend on [third-parties][] for how easy they are to find or read. I want to know that – if I so choose – I can keep them online myself for 20 years or more. I'll likely follow a [POSSE][] approach here[^1].

So I've created this new blog. I've had blogs in the past, on and off since high school. I've maintained them with greater and lesser success at times and I make no promises about how well I'll do with this one. We'll see how it goes.
