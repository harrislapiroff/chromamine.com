Why do I want to have a blog?

1. **I used to write.** I was reasonably good at it, I think. I'm pretty rusty now. I've spent the past decade or so focusing on other things, but I always told myself I could get back to writing someday if I wanted to.
2. **I want to document things I know and learn and think of.** I want to have a place to point to when someone asks me a question like "[What kind of CO₂ monitor do you use and do you like it?][co2]" or "[Why do you think contra dances should include mixers?][mixers]". I want this to share with others, but I also want it for Future Harris to refer back to. My brain is leaky. Hopefully my blog is not.
3. **I love a technical playground.** Professional work can be a limiting, especially as I find myself doing more management and less code over time. I've been a web developer and designer most of my life and I enjoy it. On top of writing, it's nice to have a place to experiment with different technologies, design ideas, etc., unconstrained by professional concerns.
4. **I can own my content.** I'll post plenty of trivial thoughts and day-to-day tidbits on social media, but, especially with the things I spend more effort on, I want to preserve them in their best format and not depend on [third-parties][] for how easy they are to find or read. I want to know that – if I so choose – I can keep them online myself for 20 years or more. I'll likely follow a [POSSE][] approach here[^1].

So I've created this new blog. I've stuck it in a design that I think is cute and the right amount of nerdy. I've played with some new technologies in the process (more on this later, probably). I've imported some older content from social media and I'll continue to plumb the my social media profiles and older blogs for things worth sharing, such that, for a while, I expect this blog will grow in two directions – out into the future and backward into the past.

I've had blogs in the past, on and off. I've maintained them with greater and lesser success at times and I make no promises about how well I'll do with this one. I will try to keep my FILDI[^2] strong. We'll see how it goes.
