I just got a fraudulent call from someone pretending to be my bank, so I thought I'd share this tidbit of security wisdom that I hope a lot of people already know, but just in case you don't: **Don't share personal information with your bank if they called you first.**

If they ask you for any personal information, especially "to verify," this is a very good sign that it is not actually your bank and is actually a scam to steal your credit card number or other personal information.

A bank may ask you to verify personal information *if you called them* but they should not ask you to verify personal information *if they called you*. If you think it might be a legitimate call anyway, you should always ask to call them back at the phone number on your card or bank statement (_not_ a number they provide you over the phone).

Here's the rough transcript of the call I just had, as an example:

> CALLER: Hello, I'm calling from Citibank because we noticed some suspicious activity on your account. Can you verify these transactions for me? [Lists a couple transactions ranging from $700–$1,000]

I had actually received a call similar to this from Citibank earlier in the week – though in that case it had been a robot who left me a voicemail. I should have been a little more suspicious, but I was also primed to think that _maybe_ there was something going on with my card.

> HARRIS: No, those weren't me.
> 
> CALLER: Okay, thank you for confirming. We are going to stop those transactions and send you a new card with a new number. I just need to verify some information to confirm you are in posession of the card. Can you get your card and–

*Now* I was pretty sure this was a scam but wanted to be 100% sure.

> HARRIS: Can I call you back at the number on my card to confirm you're actually my bank?

> CALLER: Yes you can call me back at this number.
