An OK night. There were a number more beginners and perpetual beginners than I was expecting so I had to shift from a more complex program that I had prepped. I wasn't sure I did a great job pulling along the beginners – I noticed them quite lost and off beat throughout – though nothing fell absolutely apart and I did receive a number of compliments after the dance about how clear my explanations were during the walkthrough. It is true I didn't really make any major teaching errors. I did notice a couple times when a beginner-beginner couple left the set.

One dancer also suggested I should prompt for longer when there are so many beginners, while another disagreed and said my prompting less forced the experienced dancers to learn the dances which made them more helpful. (I'm more inclined to take idea of prompting longer seriously since in either case it was apparently noticeable that I wasn't prompting so long.)

I did receive this excellent and specific compliment from a dancer:

> Can I give you some feedback? I really love that you noticed when people were lost or off beat and didn’t call anyone out but gave gentle corrections that people could notice were for them.

I was also trying to pay better attention to the Kingfisher sets since Jeff has been encouraging me to be attentive to knowing what I want the narrative of the evening to be and conveying that to the band. Here's a few sets that stood out to me:

* They did a groovy tune for Heartbeat Contra which worked nicely (and illustrated to me what Jeff told me earlier about how they'll sometimes do very percussive dances *down* instead of up)
* They did a really beautiful delicate plucky set for Summer Sunshine which was really nice.
* They did a really kickass driving final set for Train Delay.
* They played Tom Kruskal's for Butter, which was fun.

I think I'm getting decently good at efficient walkthroughs with minimal chatter. I'd like to work on reintroducing some chatter to build some charm and also teach style points.
