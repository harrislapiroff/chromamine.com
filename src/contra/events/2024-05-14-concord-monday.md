A smooth gig. Small crowd, only about 20 at peak, but dedicated. A beginner and pretty-new couple showed up after the workshop time, but since not many dancers had arrived yet, I gave a quick workshop to them to start with. They stayed through the whole first half. We had around 12 dancers for the second half, but they stuck around the entire time so we were able to keep doing contras.

It was Jack O'Connor's birthday and we had a great superband with a lot of goofing around (and a bit of scotch) on stage.

Teaches largely went pretty smoothly. Some of the trickier dances had a bit of confusion during their first walk through (Catch a Falling Star, "There is No Way to Peace; Peace is the Way") but it always evened out with a second walkthrough.
