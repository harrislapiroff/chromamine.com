A good night! I thought I hit the right level for the evening. It was a smallish dance, but large enough for a good time. 

I got ambitious enough to pull out a medley on the fly in the second half, which was fun.

I do keep getting feedback (written and approached by the occasional dancer) from dancers asking me to prompt longer. The dancers look like they're doing fine from the stage so I'm not sure how seriously to take this feedback as "I should do this to make dancers more comfy" and to what extent there will always be a few dancers who want more prompting.

I didn't get as many compliments this night as some of the events where I thought I didn't do as well. Not sure if my meter is off or this is some variation of the "waiter gets a bigger tip if something goes wrong and they fix it" phenomenon. I suppose it also just wasn't that large of a dance.
