An OK evening. Small turnout, likely due to eclipse travel, but a dedicated group who stayed till the end and humored my errors. Messed up a few more dances than I would have liked:

- **Monday:** Possibly I just left out a figure in the walkthrough? I was a little off-kilter at the start of the evening thanks to a coughing fit I was suppressing ðŸ˜¬ The dance fell apart as soon as we started dancing and I had to restart, but it went smoothly thereafter.
- **Thanks to the Gene:** Second time I've messed this deceptively simple one up! The first time, I failed to teach the progression out of the allemande effectively. It's a little tricky because larks have to know which new neighbor they're looking for. This time I instructed the larks to progress *on* the allemande, diving across the set for the next lark. This actually worked and made the dance a bit more interesting, but was an awkwardly large gap to close and the robins had to scooch up to get even with their partners.
- **Becket Brigade/The Glass Goddess:** This one was new to me and I think I messed up my notation. I called it with a *left* diagonal chain instead of a *right* diagonal chain. This actually did work, but it meant that dancers had to scoot around their shadow after the hey to find their partner which took just a little too long. Beginners also never knew where to look for their partner, so some chaos ensued. If I had called it properly with a *right* diagonal they would have been next to their partner at the end of the hey as intended (and I think the momentum would also work better coming out of the previous chain).

I was pleased with my ability to do quick walkthroughs for most of the simpler dances. We were off to a late start but I made up enough time that I almost got in an extra dance â€“ I was also calling them short since the line was short.

I was happy with how "Apogee" went. I gave some new notes on how to keep track of the orbits, which I think helped:

1. The person leaving the center of the set is always the person who goes back in for the allemande.
2. It doesn't actually matter who does the allemande and who does the orbit as long as you meet on the other side of the set.

I got a comment from a dancer that they particularly liked that one â€“ "the English-y one." This dancer also told me that "Becket Brigade" was the most enjoyable train wreck they had been part of.

I was admonished by some dancers to keep calling longer, which I did in the second half.
