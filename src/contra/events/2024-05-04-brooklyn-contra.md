The second part of a double dance.

A great, if a bit chaotic, evening dance. I was warned in advance that there would be a 14 person bachelorette party present, but they didn't end up showing until 10 minutes into the workshop. I integrated them as best I could – and it's the first time I've ever decided to allow the workshop to cut 10 minutes into the dance. I think this was a good call as it also gave the experienced dancers time to get back from the dinner break between dances, though the dividends were limited since the bachelorette party bounced pretty quickly.

I had planned a fairly easy program, but I had to scrap it and go even easier. It does make me think my collection needs more dead simple dances – probably some combination of "one night stand" type dances and glossary contras with absolutely no fuss at all.

Got some interesting dances into the second half, which I was glad for, and even managed to get all five slots I had planned. I had to cut a couple slots from the first half both because of long walkthroughs to accommodate the beginners and because there was a maypole at the break which needed time to set up.

I got a bit of feedback on my workshop that I shouldn't teach beginners the "buzz step" because:

1. they inevitably do it incorrectly which leads to more bouncing,
2. they have enough to think about without worrying about footwork, and
3. you can do a perfectly good swing walking and your partner can even still buzz step.

I've been looking for something to trim from my workshop anyway and these reasons are pretty convincing, so I think going forward I'm going to try going without the buzz step!
