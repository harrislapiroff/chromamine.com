A good night! Very well attended for a Monday Contras with two full lines in the first half and a good sizes single line in the second half.

I started off with a no walkthrough because I noticed there were no beginners at all. A few beginners showed up midway through that dance, but dancers were good about quickly incorporating them. My dances all went well with a single walk through for most of them, despite some of them having some more complex figures. I did two walkthroughs for Catch A Falling Star.

The band really killed it. It was fun splitting the night with Tommy and getting to dance some of the evening as well. Dancing Wrinkled Ribbon instead of calling it was great, since it's a regular in my repertoire. It brought me a new realization which is that the timing is a little fuzzy – I kept ending the allemande early and that was fine! Could be a teaching note to add.
