A good dance! Two lines at peak, one long line for most of the evening. Almost all experienced dancers with two pretty new people and a few more fairly new people, which made for a pretty smooth calling experience despite a little anxious sloppiness on my part (saying "neighbor" instead of "partner" a few times, leaving out a circle L 3 on the first walkthrough, and other errors along those lines.)

Thanks to the Gene turned out to be a tricky starter dance because it has a tricky progression that I didn't notice until we reached it. I think it would work in the future, but I have to remember to identify neighbors early for that one.

Emma suggested to me afterward that instead of teaching people to get into Becket Indecent for Soul Reversal, I can get them into becket and have them alle L with their partner 3/4 to get into a short wavy line with the larks in the center. In that case I will have to be clear *that is not part of the dance* and also that they should wait out indecent, but it might still be smoother and less perturbing to the dancers.
