Starting in **2018** I am the full-time **Principal Web Developer** at [**Freedom of the Press Foundation**](https://freedom.press/).

From **2014 through 2017** I co-founded, managed, and worked at [**Little Weaver Web Collective**](https://littleweaverweb.com/), a worker-cooperative web development agency. There I designed and developed websites for clients such as [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press/) and [Detroit Public Radio](http://wdet.org/).

From **2011 through 2013** I was a web developer at **Oberlin College** where I led a team developing high profile websites from the homepage to the news center as well as a few [jokes](http://www2.oberlin.edu/kittens/).

In **2011** Ma'ayan Plaut and I made a [splash](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/11/08/marketing-experts-praise-unusual-website-about-oberlin) in higher education marketing with our (unofficial) project [**Why The Fuck Should I Choose Oberlin?**](http://whythefuckshouldichooseoberlin.com/)

In **2010** I graduated from **Oberlin College** with a B.A. in Mathematics (with a concentration in Applied Mathematics) and a minor in Creative Writing.

I built my first website in **1999**. It had an animated GIF of a computer with my name on it. I've been trying to make something as satisfying ever since.
