Starting in **November 2017** I am taking a leave of absence from Little Weaver Web Collective and will be **available for independent hire**. If you have projects for one skilled developer, please [drop me a line](mailto:harris@chromamine.com). If you have larger projects, I can't recommend my colleagues at [Little Weaver](http://littleweaverweb.com/) highly enough.

Since **2014** I have been a co-founder and worker-owner at [**Little Weaver Web Collective**](http://littleweaverweb.com/), where I've designed and developed websites for clients such as [Freedom of the Press Foundation](http://freedom.press/) and [Detroit Public Radio](http://wdet.org/).

From **2011 through 2013** I was a web developer at **Oberlin College** where I led a team developing the [Oberlin homepage](http://home.oberlin.edu/) and the [Oberlin News Center](http://news.oberlin.edu/) as well as a [joke](http://oberlin.edu/kittens/) or [two](https://new.oberlin.edu/home/nyan/).

In **2011** Ma'ayan Plaut and I made a [splash](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/11/08/marketing-experts-praise-unusual-website-about-oberlin) in higher education marketing with our (unofficial) project [**Why The Fuck Should I Choose Oberlin?**](http://whythefuckshouldichooseoberlin.com/)

In **2010** I graduated from **Oberlin College** with a B.A. in Mathematics (with a concentration in Applied Mathematics) and a minor in Creative Writing.

I built my first website in **1999**. It had an animated GIF of a computer with my name on it. I've been trying to make something as satisfying ever since.
