**My name's Harris Lapiroff. I write code and live in DC.**

Since 2014 I have been a co-founder and worker-owner at [Little Weaver Web Collective](http://littleweaverweb.com/), a web development agency with principles.

From 2011 through 2013 I was a web developer at Oberlin College where I led a team developing websites such as the [Oberlin homepage](http://home.oberlin.edu/) and the [Oberlin News Center](http://news.oberlin.edu/) as well as a [joke](http://oberlin.edu/kittens/) or [two](https://new.oberlin.edu/home/nyan/).

In 2011 Ma'ayan Plaut and I made a [splash](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/11/08/marketing-experts-praise-unusual-website-about-oberlin) in higher education marketing with our (unofficial) project [Why The Fuck Should I Choose Oberlin?](http://whythefuckshouldichooseoberlin.com/)

In 2010 I graduated from Oberlin College with a B.A. in Mathematics (with a concentration in Applied Mathematics) and a minor in Creative Writing.

I built my first website in 1999. Is had an animated GIF of a computer with my name on it. I've been trying to make something as satisfying ever since.
